      <description>Skills In this lab, we will practice computing descriptive statistics and making plots in R for a dataset about animal sleep habits. First, download the template R Markdown file for Lab 01 here . Open this template in RStudio.
In R Markdown files, you can switch between text and code. This line is text, but below is a code chunk. In your template file, the first code chunk has the name load_data and the options warning = F, message = F.</description>

      <description>Most the instructions here are taken from Chapter 1 of Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown by Ismay and Kennedy and this associated tutorial. See also Chapter 1 of Statistical Inference via Data Science by Ismay and Kim. Before your first lab section, you should follow the steps below to install R, RStudio, and R Markdown. To keep things brief, I have put explanations of why we want to use these tools at the end of these instructions.</description>
