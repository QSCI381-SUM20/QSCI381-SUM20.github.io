## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r storms, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
data("storms") # load toy dataset

# plot histogram for the maximum wind speeds (knots)
hist(storms$wind)
```
