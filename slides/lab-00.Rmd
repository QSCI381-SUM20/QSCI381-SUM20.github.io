# Installing R

---
class: middle

Most the instructions here are taken from Chapter 1 of [*Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown*](https://rbasics.netlify.app/) by Ismay and Kennedy and [this associated tutorial](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/software/R/r_studio.html). See also Chapter 1 of [*Statistical Inference via Data Science*](https://moderndive.com/index.html) by Ismay and Kim. 

<br>
Before your first lab section, you should follow the steps below to install R, RStudio, and R Markdown. 

<br>
To keep things brief, I have put explanations of why we want to use these tools at the end of these instructions. 

---
#### 1. Download and install R by going to https://cloud.r-project.org.

```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/01_R.png")
```
---
#### 1. Download and install R by going to https://cloud.r-project.org.

<br>

  * **If you are a Windows user**: Click on “**Download R for Windows**”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link.

<br>

  * **If you are a macOS user**: Click on “**Download R for (Mac) OS X**”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of June 12, 2020 was R-4.0.1.
  
<br>
  
  * **If you are a Linux user**: Click on “**Download R for Linux**” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.
---
#### 2. Download and install RStudio at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.

```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/01_rstudio.png")
```
---

#### 2. Download and install RStudio at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.

  * Click the button that says “**Download R for xxxx**,” referring to your computer's operating system. Run the installer program.
---
#### 3. Now, open RStudio on your computer. You should see a window that looks like this.

```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/01_rstudio_window.png")
```
---
#### 4. Your RStudio window is typically divided into four panes, as shown below. Find the console pane.

```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/01_rstudio_annot.png")
```
---

<br>
<br>

####5. Copy and paste the following line into the console

```{r hello, eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

and then press Enter/Return to run your first line of code!

<br>
Follow the instructions and answer yes if prompted. 

<br>
This line of code will install some helpful "**packages**," which you can think of as **upgrades to R**. These packages include additional functions and tools that we will use this quarter. 

<br>
**6. Now, close and reopen RStudio to finish installing your packages.**

# Compiling your first lab report

---
class: middle
When you write your lab reports this quarter, you are **recommended but not required to use** R Markdown, a tool that makes it easy to combine code and output in one document. In this section we will make sure R Markdown works on your computer and practice compiling a lab report. 

<br>
#### 7. First, download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QSCI381-SUM20/QSCI381-SUM20.github.io/master/post/lab-00/lab_00_template.Rmd"><b>Lab 00 Template</b></a> and open it in RStudio.
---
When you open the file, it should appear in the Script pane. Hopefully, it looks something like this:

<br>
```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/00_template.png")
```

---
#### 8. Put your name and the date in the appropriate places in the header.

<br>
You should also see a block of code that looks like this:
````markdown
`r ''````{r storms, eval = F}
    library(tidyverse)
    data("storms") # load toy dataset
    
    # plot histogram for the maximum wind speeds (knots)
    hist(storms$wind)
```
````


<br>
This is called a **code chunk**. R Markdown is helpful because you can include code and text together.

<br>
**Try running each line of code, one at a time, in the console.** Equivalently, click **Knit** to run all code in your .Rmd file at once. This should produce a **.html** file of your lab report. Submit this html file on Canvas. You have now finished Lab 00!

We'll talk more about the details of all of this, but for now, it is enough that you installed R and checked that R Markdown works. If you are interested, see the next few slides.

### Why R?

"R is an open-source programming language that has seen its popularity grow tremendously in recent years, with developers adding new functionality via packages on a daily basis." (Ismay and Kennedy, 2019).

Broadly speaking, you should think of R as a fancy calculator. You give R specific commands (in the language of code), and R will follow your instructions.
---

### Why RStudio?

"RStudio is a graphical development environment that makes it easier to write and view the results of R code" (Ismay and Kennedy, 2019).

RStudio makes it easier to collect all your R commands into a single file, or script. By saving your script, you can create a record of everything you told the computer to do. RStudio also makes it easy to write reports with R Markdown and to work on plots/figures.

### Why R Markdown?

"R Markdown provides an easy way to produce rich, fully-documented, reproducible analyses" (Ismay and Kennedy, 2019).

Instead of copying/pasting code and figures into a Word document, you can use R Markdown to combine text, code, and figures in one unified document. There is a learning curve, but once you get the hang of using R Markdown, you can create reports that clearly communicate how you conducted your statistical analyses.
